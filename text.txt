The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.
The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow!
Waltz, nymph, for quick jigs vex Bud.
Jumpy wizards quickly vex the big Sphinx of quartz.
The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
